      <h2>Welcome to my page</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Erica, and I'm an aspiring web developer. I feel its
        unexpected of me to be entering this field as my educational and career
        backgrounds are not technical.The majority of my background has been in
        customer service. As someone who has worked in various industries, from
        e-commerce to brick-and-mortar retail, technology had always played a
        significant role. Whether it be software for tracking orders, processing
        insurance quotes, or for analyzing sales projections, the effectiveness
        of all of these tools can either make or break a company's success. I've
        always been intrigued by the notion that someone built these programs.On
        a more personal level, my husband also happens to be a software
        engineer. Time and time again, I've seen him develop game-changing
        software solutions at numerous companies over the years, most recently
        at his own company - a Y Combinator-funded startup. I feel lucky because
        I've procured firsthand knowledge of what it's like to traverse the
        startup space.With 8 years of customer service experience and seeing the
        importance of software at every company I've worked at, I feel compelled
        to learn more about software development. I have chosen to pursue web
        development because web presence is essential in most of the businesses
        that we rely on today. I look forward to playing an active role in the
        production and maintenance of a business's web technology stack one day.
